### Project Feedback + (self)Evaluation

- **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- **Creativity**: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?

- **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as tab indentation, DRYness, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

- **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
